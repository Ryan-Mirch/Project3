#DIVIDE

A procedurally generated infinite runner type game.

Imagine the game snake, but you can only go forward, and when you tap the screen you split into 2 snakes. 

More specifically...

- Obstacles will appear, and the only way to avoid them is by dividing, splitting yourself into multiple branches.
- Every other time you tap the screen, your branches will either split, or straighten.

- If two branches hit each other, they will combine into a single straight branch.
- If any branch hits a trap, you lose a life.
- If a branch hits an obstacle, the branch stops.

- You lose if all branches have stopped, or if you lose all of your lives.

Work left to finish:
- polish main menu view
- polish how to play view
- polish game over popup
- add game sounds
- incorporate google play
- add ads
- publish to google play store
