#DIVIDE

A procedurally generated infinite runner type game.

Imagine the game snake, but you can only go forward, and when you tap the screen you split into 2 snakes. 

More specifically...

- Obstacles will appear, and the only way to avoid them is by dividing, splitting yourself into multiple branches.
- When all branches are going straight, tapping the screen will split every branch.
- When any branch is going diagonally, tapping the screen will straigthen every branch.
- If two branches hit each other, they will combine into a single straight branch.
- If any branch hits a trap, you lose a life.
- If a branch hits an obstacle, the branch stops.
- You lose if all branches have stopped, or if you lose all of your lives.
