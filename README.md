DIVIDE

The Game:
- The goal in this single-button infinite runner is to survive as long as possible. 
- Obstacles will appear, and the only way to avoid them is by dividing, splitting yourself into multiple branches.
- Every other time you tap the screen, your branches will either split, or straighten.

- If two branches hit each other, they will combine into a single straight branch.
- If any branch hits a trap, you lose a life.
- If a branch hits an obstacle, the branch stops.

- You lose if all branches have stopped, or if you lose all of your lives.
