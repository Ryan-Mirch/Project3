DIVIDE

The Game:
- The goal in this single-button infinite runner is to survive as long as possible. 
- Obstacles will appear, and the only way to avoid them is by dividing, splitting yourself into two branches.
- Every time you tap the screen, all branches that are traveling straight will divide, and all other branches will straighten.
- If two branches hit each other, they will combine into a single straight branch.
- If any branch hits an obstacle, you lose.

Current Progress:

I look forward to updating this game for future projects in this class.
